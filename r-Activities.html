  <h2>COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</h2>
  <h3>Elsie Gaches Village</h3>
  <blockquote>Junior Philippine Institute of Accountants - MMCL Chapter conducted an event of community engagement with the theme "Empower Through Involvement: Building Inclusive Communities in Elsie Gaches Village." This initiative fostered connection and inclusivity, impacting the residents through interactive games and lively performances from both the officers and residents. The Elsie Gaches Village in Alabang, Muntinlupa City, serves as a refuge for individuals with intellectual and mental conditions who have faced abandonment, neglect, or abuse. The organization gave essential donations to further support the communityâ€™s needs. Through this initiative, JPIA-MMCL hopes to provide a space where individuals with special needs are valued and supported, offering them opportunities to learn, grow, and experience the warmth of a truly accepting community.</blockquote>
